Erik Rose's talks:

    http://pyvideo.org/video/1784/elasticsearch-part-1-indexing-and-querying

    Elasticsearch provides an easy path to clusterable full-text
    search, with synonyms, faceting, and geographic math, but there's
    a paucity of written wisdom beyond its API docs. This talk, part 1
    of a 2-part series, surveys its capabilities and shows how its
    internal data structures and algorithms work. With the groundwork
    laid, we explore how to choose efficient indexing and the right
    queries to make your apps go fast.
